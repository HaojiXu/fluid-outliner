## FAQs

1. **What is an outliner?**

  An application that helps you organize trees of information. Think of it as a bullet list on steroids.

2. **How do I install it ?**

  You can visit [this site](https://fluid-notion.github.io/fluid-outliner/) in your browser. Fluid Outliner is a web based application, no separate installation step is required.

3. **Can I access it offline ?**
  
  Yes. If you have visited the above site once while connected to internet, then you will be able to access it even when offline.

4. **Where is my data saved ?**
  
  Only in your browser.

  When you create an outline in your browser, it is simply cached in your browser's storage. You can save these outlines as files, open them in the application again, or share them with others.

  Your data is not saved to any servers and is not shared with any third party services.

  We may introduce synchronization through cloud services in future, but it will always be opt in and Fluid Outliner will always be a privacy aware utility.

5. **Can I use it on mobile ?**

  Not yet. But mobile support is expected to improve in very near future.
